# Web Developer Training

This is a completely free and open source web developer training course. It is self-paced and requires self-motivation. For those interested, I do offer mentorship.

## Mentorship

I will personally mentor you for $500 per month. Mentorship includes 4 one-hour video mentorship sessions per month, as well as random access chats, texts, emails, or whatever throughout the week. We will work together, creating sprints, opening issues, and doing code reviews and pull requests as you master the fundamentals and build a personal project. If you're interested, just reach out:

I've poured my heart and soul into organizing this course. It reflects all of my years of study and practice. It is what I will be using to train new developers who work with me. Whenever people ask for the best way to learn web development, this is where I'll lead them. My name is Jordan Last, and I'm a full stack web application developer.
