# Web Developer Training

Hello there, young traveler. I see that you are embarking on a remarkable journey, a journey of courage, determination, hard work, and skill. If you so choose, I will be your guide. I have walked and continue to walk my own path of discovery. I have suffered much. I have learned much. I have gained much. I wish to share what I have learned, in hopes of a better path for you. I have many opinions, and I will share them freely. Take them as they are...opinions, gained in the furnace of development. Some could be wrong, some could be right. Choose wisely who and what you will trust.

This guide is split into two major parts.

## Tutorials

The first part is known as the Tutorials. These tutorials use project-based learning to teach you web application development from the ground up. We start with no tools, no frameworks, and no libraries. We build concept upon concept until mastery of the fundamentals. Remember, you must master the fundamentals.

## Reference Materials

The second part is known as the Reference Materials. Hopefully these are self-explanatory. If you want more in-depth study, go here. The reference materials are knowledge distilled and organized as coherently as possible. If you find room for improvement, don't hesitate to offer suggestions. But be wise.

## Fundamentals and First Principles

This guide is designed to instill in you a love and understanding of the fundamentals and first principles of web application development. You must master the fundamentals. You must master the first principles. Complex solutions are built out of simpler solutions. Complex concepts are made from simpler concepts. Skimp on your understanding of the fundamentals and suffer the consequeunces. Do not underestimate the power of first principles. Again, I shall repeat, do not underestimate the power of first principles.

## Mentorship

Not all can make this journey alone. In fact, it may be foolish to do so. I will personally mentor you. We will work together, creating sprints, opening issues, doing code reviews and pull requests as you master the fundamentals and build a personal project. If you're interested, just reach out:

## Final Words

I've poured my heart and soul into organizing this course. It reflects all of my years of study and practice. It is what I will be using to train new developers who work with me. Whenever people ask for the best way to learn web development, this is where I'll lead them.
