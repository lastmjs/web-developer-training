# Mentorship

My name is Jordan Last, and I would like to mentor you.

If you just want to get started, our first session is free, no strings attached. Just sign up for a time: https://calendly.com/webdevelopertraining

Here's a little bit about me:

* I'm the creator of [Zwitterion](https://github.com/lastmjs/zwitterion), [Podcrypt](https://podcrypt.app/), [Wasm Metal](https://github.com/lastmjs/wasm-metal), and [much more](https://github.com/lastmjs)
* I consistently have over 3000 contributions per year on [GitHub](https://github.com/lastmjs)
* I'm a full stack developer, prolific open source author, and I love the web platform
* I also love to teach

I focus on deep practical mastery of the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Web components
* Redux
* GraphQL
* Node.js
* Functional programming
* AWS (especially Lambda)
* WebAssembly
* Docker
* Blockchain

Mentorship is currently $200 per month, and includes 4 personalized 1-hour video sessions (these can be very flexible), with emails, texts, and phone calls as I'm available.

The first session is free. We'll get to know each other, learn some web development, and I'll get to know your specific needs. We'll see if it's a good match, no strings attached.
