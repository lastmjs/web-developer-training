# Mentorship

My name is Jordan Last, and I would like to mentor you.

Here's a little bit about me:

* I'm the creator of [Zwitterion](https://github.com/lastmjs/zwitterion), [Podcrypt](https://podcrypt.app/), [Wasm Metal](https://github.com/lastmjs/wasm-metal), and [much more](https://github.com/lastmjs)
* I consistently have over 3000 contributions per year on [GitHub](https://github.com/lastmjs)
* I'm a full stack developer, prolific open source author, and I love the web platform
* I also love to teach

I focus on deep practical mastery of the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Web components
* Redux
* GraphQL
* Node.js
* Functional programming
* AWS (especially Lambda)
* WebAssembly
* Docker
* Blockchain

Mentorship is currently $100 per month, and includes 4 personalized 1-hour video sessions (these can be very flexible), with emails, texts, and phone calls as I'm available.

The first session is free. We'll get to know each other, I'll get to know your specific needs, and we'll see if it's a good match, no strings attached.
