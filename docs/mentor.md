# Web Developer Training

## Mentorship

Hello there, young traveler. I see that you are embarking on a remarkable journey, a journey of courage, determination, hard work, and skill. If you so choose, I will be your guide. I have walked and continue to walk my own path of discovery. I have suffered much. I have learned much. I have gained much. I wish to share what I have learned, in hopes of a better path for you. Choose wisely who and what you will trust.

## Who am I?

## How does it work?

Mentorship is $100 per month. We'll have four one hour video sessions per month at a time that works for you. I'm also available outside of the video sessions to answer questions through phone calls, texts, emails, etc. The format of the mentorship is flexible. We can work through custom or freely available curriculum, we can answer your burning questions, we can build example applications, we can walk through popular open source projects' source code...we can really go in any direction you want. I can hold you accountable and be a strict teacher, a flexible tutor, or a useful mentor - you choose.
